Team - not group - project to develop a 2D game in Unity.

Team are groups of 2 to 4 people:
* Team projects are expected to be more ambitious than individual projects.
* Each member of the team has a role. Their assessment is based on their performance in the role. There is not a "group grade." There is, however, a score on the project. The team is responsible for allocating those points and explaining the rationale.
* Idle (nothing to do) team members cost the team points on the team score.
* Off task team members should be docked a portion of the team points.
