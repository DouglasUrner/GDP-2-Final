## Overview

For our final project we will be creating games (the design should be "final" but the electronic version can be a logical prototype). The focus of the project will be on designing and playtesting your game - to enable you to focus on those elements we will have the PlaygroundProject 2D game toolkit available. Use of the toolkit is optional, it's purpose is to enable you to quickly build prototypes and test out ideas.

This can be a **team** project, but it is not a "group" project. You are encouraged to collaborate, but each person's contributions are scored individually.

It is also important to manage time in the project. The last day of school is Monday the 18th, but for seniors the last day is Friday the 8th of June. Seniors who have commitments of the 4th will want to take that into account as well. Groups with seniors in them must take this into account. There are 10 days left (including today, not incuding the 18th for B-day classes).
